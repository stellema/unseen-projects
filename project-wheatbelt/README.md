# UNSEEN analysis of growing season rainfall (GSR) events in Western and South Australian low-cropping regions

## Notebooks
#### `prepare_shapefile.ipynb`  
Generates the shapefiles corresponding to the study regions (used by `Makefile`).

#### `analysis_{model-name}.ipynb`
Presents the analysis of each model.
Created by creating a file list using the relevant script in the `file_lists/` directory and then the `Makefile`.
See [README.md](https://github.com/AusClimateService/unseen-projects/blob/master/README.md).

#### `obs.ipynb`
Plots Australian Gridded Climate Data (AGCD) GSR time series and autocorrelation
in the WA and SA regions.

## Python scripts

These scripts require first saving the AGCD and DCPP model Apr-Oct rainfall (global grid and over the SA and WA regions) - see [wheatbelt_config.mk](https://github.com/AusClimateService/unseen-projects/blob/master/project-wheatbelt/wheatbelt_config.mk).

#### `process_gsr_data.py`
Defines paths for datafiles and where to save figures.
Contains functions to load and process GSR data from AGCD and DCPP models.
Returns datasets of GSR variables `pr`, `decile` or `tercile`. The function `gsr_data_regions` returns GSR data averaged over the WA and SA regions (stacked along dimension `x`). The `gsr_data_aus_AGCD` and `gsr_data_aus_DCPP` functions return GSR variables on their native grid subset to Australia south of around 25S. Also prints information on model grid and sample sizes.

#### `gsr_events.py`
Contains functions to define n-year GSR events and calculate transition probabilities. GSR events are based on consecutive years of low or high decile/tercile GSR. 
Includes functions to calculat: confidence intervals, transition probabilities, downsampled_transition_probability, transition_time, . Note that transition probabilities use a modified event definition that includes overlapping years.

#### `plot_gsr_regions.py`
Contains functions to plot event statistics and transition probabilities for the WA and SA regions.

#### `plot_gsr_maps.py`
Contains functions to plot spatial maps of event statistics and transition probabilities.


## Software environment

The command line programs used by the Makefile and conda environments can be found at [UNSEEN package](https://github.com/AusClimateService/unseen).
